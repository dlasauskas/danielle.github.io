      <h2>WHAT DOES DESIGN MEAN TO ME?</h2>
        <p>My career in the design field has been an ongoing development since I was a child. From the beginning, I’ve always been in love with art. It is the perfect blend of communication and visual expression.
          <p>
            <b>Purposeful Planning</b>
            I like to think I began my career in the fourth grade when an art project went south and I was able to convince my teacher to let me start over with a newly revised and better thought out plan on how to complete my puppy drawing with a well executed sketch  and determination to make my vision come to life. Through this experience I learned that a vision, planning, sketches, and communication would allow me to bring my creativity to life.
          </p>

          <b>Love of Learning</b>
          In grade school I was introduced to the program paint. I was mesmerized that I could draw on a computer. As our teacher walked by we chatted about this new program. I distinctly remember telling her that it is what I wanted to do when I grew up. I focused on my ambition to create art and after a few years of high school art classes, I was introduced to the Adobe Creative Suite. My heart was on fire. I was head over heels with this program… it was essentially the big sister to paint and I knew then that I would make a career combing my love for art and working on the computer through this program. SInce then I’ve continued learning new programs and pushed my career from primarily print based to UI/UX Design.
          </p>
          <p>
          <b>Empathetic Design</b>
          I’ve always been curious about understanding the perspective of others, whether it was for personal or professional reasons, stepping into another persons shoes always allows everyone to have the best experience. To understand what inspires others, what they need and what their goals are allows me to connect with an audience on a deeper level. This understanding pushed me to dive into the UX/UI Design to create data driven, user focused design.
          </p>
          <p>
          <b>Love of Helping Other</b>
          To me, being a designer is so much more than making art on the computer. It is a way to connect with aspiring professionals looking to grow their careers, businesses, and audiences. I fell in love with the organization and psychology aspect, I developed a love for researching new topics so I could design them clearly and educate others by giving a voice to the client or product at hand. I’ve always had a burning desire to make a larger impact and help others succeed, design in my platform to do so
          </p>
          <p>
          <b>Why is design important to me?</b>
          Design is important to me because it is a means of communication. It allows ideas to manifest visually in the world to spread a message in an beautiful way. I also love to organize (you should see my closet, it is organized by type of shirt, then light to dark colors!) and design allows me to merge organizing materials in a way that is understandable while incorporating my love for art.

      <h2>WHAT AM I UP TO?</h2>
        <p>Being a print and UX/UI designer allows me to create a full experience for an audience. From paper products to digital I am able to help others achieve their goals, weather it be for a social cause, personal need, or helping other grow through marketing materials. In my own personal life, it has allowed me to enjoy working for a number of fantastic companies pursing a career in digital art and allowing me time to explore fine art on he side. I am currently happily employed with a real estate marketing company and am continuing to develop my design skills through online bootcamps and spec projects!
