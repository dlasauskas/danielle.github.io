      <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
      <p>Create an application in the growing cloud based storage scene, that combines multiple features and a unique approach.</p>
      <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
      <p>This app will allow users a place to create content, store things needed to be successful, and when ready, share it with others to continue development and finalize projects  in a secure environment.</p>

        <h3>THE PROCESS</h3>
          <h2>USER SURVEY</h2>
            <p>In order to better understand what type of cloud based storage app would best serve Cocoon users, I created a user survey and questioned 23 students, entrepreneurs and full-tim/part-time employees.</p>
            <p>The questions in this survey were design to understand what users may be using now, what they like, don’t like and what they are missing.</p>
              <section>
                <p>Example Questions:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>What do cloud based applications mean to you?</li>
                  <li>What type of information do you share?</li>
                  <li>What features do you feel like you are missing in your cloud based apps?</li>
                  <li>What purposes do you use cloud based apps for?</li>
                  <li>Have you run into any issues with cloud based apps?</li>
                  <li>What is your monthly budget for cloud based apps?</li>
                  <li>What is your education level? What is your age?</li>
                </ul>
              </section>

          <h2>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h2>
            <p>By completing the SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) of Evernote, Google Drive, and Pinterest I found there was a disconnect between the ability to create content, store content, and collaborate with others. This disconnect provided a unique niche for the Cocoon platform.</p>

            <h2>USER STORIES</h2>
              <p>For the MVP (minimum viable product), tasks were weighed by priority. These tasks and others went into creating the user flows and wire frame.</p>

              <p>The user flow of the Cocoon app is set up to easily switch between storing, creating and collaborating. In order to provide a seamless flow within the application, stories were created for:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Add Collaborators</li>

            <h2>WIREFRAMES</h2>
              <p>Initial sketch wireframes were created to help with the visual information architecture and pattern delveopment.</p>

        <h2>BRANDING</h2>
          <p>Cocoon encaptures a structured and secure environment to create what is needed for users to evolve their professional ideas by creating content, storing content, and sharing ideas and projects using collaboration boards. The logo includes a cocoon shape internally and has a butterfly shape overall to symbolize the evolution and progression which will come from using the app.</p>
              <section>
                <h2>TYPEOGRAPHY</h2>
                  <p><b>QUICKSAND:</b>The stroke and shape of Quicksand blends with the thin details of butterfly icon and does not distract the viewer from the imagery.</p>
                  <p><b>GEORGIA:</b>Traditional serif style font that can easily be read at a smaller size for body copy areas.</p>
                  <p>Together these fonts evoke a useful and simple, let luxurious, professional application.</p>
                <h2>COLOR PALETTE</h2>
                  <p>Cocoon is contemporary yet bold in color selection. It is a fresh approach that is bold in color but simplistic in style.</p>
                  <p>The color palettes can be customized for those who need a more simplistic color palette.</p>

              <h2>MOCKUPS</h2>
              <p>Once branding and wireframes were created, I was able to begin my mockups. To start, I created simple low-fidelity mockups based on the wirefram sketches to finalize my layout decisions and do user testing. After testing  I altered the designs for the high-fidelity mockups and final round of user testing.</p>

                      <h2>USER TESTING ROUND ONE</h2>
                        <p>Remote and in person testers were tasked with:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Creating an account</li>
                          <li>Adding content</li>
                          <li>Organizing content</li>
                        </ul>
                      <h2>RESULTS</h2>
                        <p>Through my first round of testing I found that users wanted</p>
                        <p><b>Clearer Tags: </b>For example, instead of calling the organization “tags” maybe just say “organize with tags” or “organize”.</p>
                        <p><b>Easier Navigation: </b>Added sub heads to the other pages (content, folders) to be clickable rather than just a button at the side.</p>

                        <p>Remote and in person testers were tasked with providing feedback on:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Layout</li>
                          <li>Visual Appeal</li>
                        </ul>
                      <h2>RESULTS</h2>
                        <p>Through my second round of testing I found that users wanted:</p>
                        <p><b>More Contrast: </b>The initial design color choices worked well on a desktop platform, however, feedback indicated that it didn’t translate as well once responsive and smaller.</p>
                        <p><b>More Focus: </b>Users felt there was a lot I was able to find that my users want to customize their internal workspace to match their branding.</p>
                        <p><b>Customization: </b>Users wanted to be able to customize the color palette to match their own branding.</p>
                    </section>
              <h2>REVISED HIGH-FIDELITY MOCKUPS</h2>
                <p>Using the feedback from round two of testing lead me to making revisions on the internal color palette, customization option and landing page layout.</p>
              <h2>PREFERENCE TESTING</h2>
                <p>After making the final changeds from the second round of high-fidelity mockups I conducted a preference through UsabilityHub.</p>
                  <h2>Landing Page</h2>

                <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
                  <p>After much user reasearch, surveys, and desiging, Cocoon is now a fully functional app concept which allows an affordable and functional approach with the room to further develop down the road!</p>
                <h2>FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS</h2>
                  <p>Video Conferencing: Live video streaming for conference calls and file sharing while on screen and increased functionality of social media sharing. This was found as a potential need during user testing but wasn’t a high enough priority to make it into the MVP.</p>
